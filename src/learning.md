# Learning

1. [The Art of Command Line] is a very good resource to discover what to learn.
2. To discover what a command does, generally type:

    ```bash
    man <command>
    <command> -h  # or
    <command> --help
    ```

3. If you install [`tealdeer`], you can type:

    ```bash
    tldr <command>
    ```

    This will show you example command usage with easy to understand descriptions.

3. [explainshell.com] maps a command and its args to the `man` page explanations.


## Tips

1. Spam the **Tab** key.
2. Learn to navigate lines / words &ndash; Ctrl A / Ctrl E; Alt B / Alt F.
3. Learn to delete by line / word &ndash; Ctrl U / Ctrl K; Ctrl W / Alt D.
4. Learn to undo edits &ndash; Ctrl Shift Underscore.
5. Interrupt / cancel the current input or command &ndash; Ctrl C.

> You are dangerous when you know a command exists, and run it without knowing what it does.
