# Why Command Line?

1. If documentation is "recorded steps for a human to execute",  
   then command line is "recorded steps for a computer to execute".

2. Good balance between:

    - Steps that a human can read and write relatively quickly.
    - Steps that a computer can understand.

3. The script *is* software, so once it is written, it can be re-run by re-entering the commands.

    Tends to be faster than guiding a person through a graphical user interface.

4. Different steps of a process can be chained together relatively quickly.

    ```bash
    step_1 |
    step_2 |
    step_3

    echo qqwwww  |
    tr 'qw' 'ha' |
    rev
    ```

5. This is a **transferable skill** &ndash; this can be used:

    - in different products
    - in different teams
    - in different workplaces
