# Why Not Command Line?

1. Difficult in general.

    With a website, you are given menus / options to select. So a new user may learn by clicking.

    With a command line interface, you have a text box. There's no hint how to begin.

2. Easy to miscommunicate with the computer.
3. Errors can be catastrophic.
4. Large scripts tend to be difficult to understand.
5. No type safety.

When writing anything with more than 100 lines, consider using a typed, compiled language.

The type safety and compilation will make errors more visible, before you execute the logic.
